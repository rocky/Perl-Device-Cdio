Revision history for Device-Cdio

0.0.1  Feb 10, 2006
       Initial release. 

What's here from libcdio. Most everything from 
  <cdio/audio.h> 
  <cdio/device.h>
  <cdio/disc.h> 
  <cdio/read.h> 
  <cdio/track.h>

In lay terms, this is the audio CD controls, device controls, disc
classification, various block CD read routines, and some track
routines.

What's not here (yet) is CD-Text reading, CD-Paranoia interface, the
ISO 9660 library or the (SCSI) MMC command interface.

An oft-asked for request is for UDF support, analogous to the ISO
9660 support. That's currently missing in libcdio.

If there is something in this list you want, dig in. Much of it is
this is straightforward based on continuing what's here.

It was an incredible amount of work to get just this far.
