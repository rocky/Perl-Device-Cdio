A description of the example programs.

audio.pl      show mostly audio (analog) controls. Can be used to play
	      a CD. Because libcdio supports Disc Images as well as a real
	      CD-ROM, a CDRWIN (BIN/CUE), cdrdao (TOC) or Nero NRG disc
	      image can be played as well. Run --help to get a list of 
              options

cdchange.pl:  A program to test if a CD has been changed since the last
	      change test.

device.pl     A program to show drive capabilities..
	      Various drives on various OS/s may or may not report
              information correctly. (Perhaps someday libcdio will figure
	      out enough work arounds. voluneteers welcome!)

drives.pl:    A program list CD-ROMs and CD properties in the drives.
	      Various drives on various OS/s may or may not report
              information correctly. (Perhaps someday libcdio will figure
	      out enough work arounds. voluneteers welcome!)

eject.pl      A program eject a CD from a CD-ROM drive and then close the door
	      again.

tracks.pl     A program to list track numbers and logical sector
